# ðŸ‘‰ Day 56 Challenge

I've included a csv file ('100MostStreamedSongs.csv') in this repl that contains data from a music streaming service.

Your program should:

1. Read in the data.
2. Categorize the songs by artist, like this:
    1. Create one empty folder per artist.
    2. Create one blank text file per song by that artist in the relevant folder. The file name of the text file should be the name of the song.

- For each artist, check the directory to see if they already have a folder. If they do, use it. If not, create it.
